/- # The Dedekind-MacNeille Completion

A **completion** is an embedding of a partially ordered set into a complete lattice. In this chapter we describe one such completion, the Dedekind-MacNeille (DM) Completion, which is a generalization of the Dedekind cuts method of constructing the real numbers from the rational numbers. In particular, we define `DM P` for any poset `P`. If `P=ℚ`, the result is isomorphic to the reals with `-∞` and `∞`, but the approach works for any poset.

Formally, the Dedekind-MacNeille completion `DM P` is defined to be the family of subsets of `S ⊆ P` that are closed with respect to the closure operator `λ P ↦ lower (upper P)`.  -/

structure DM (P : Type u) [Poset P] where
  val : Set P
  h : lower (upper val) = val

/- Our goal is to show that `DM P` is a complete lattice for any `P`. We can easily show that `DM P` is a poset under the usual `⊆` ordering.  -/

instance DM.poset {P : Type u} [Poset P] : Poset (DM P) :=
  ⟨
    λ ⟨ A, hA ⟩ ⟨ B, hB ⟩ => A ⊆ B,
    by
      intro ⟨ A, _ ⟩
      exact Set.Subset.refl A,
    by
      intro ⟨ A, hA ⟩ ⟨ B, hB ⟩ h1 h2
      simp_all
      exact Set.Subset.antisymm h1 h2,
    by
      intro ⟨ A, hA ⟩ ⟨ B, hB ⟩ ⟨ C, hC ⟩ h1 h2
      exact Set.Subset.trans h1 h2
  ⟩

/- In fact, the `DM` structure forms what Davey and Priestly call a _topped intersection structure_, which we will show is a Complete Lattice with a particular definition for the meet and join that we define next. -/


/- ## The Meet

We define a _meet_ for `DM P`, which is just set-intersection taken over a subset of `DM P`.

$$
\mathrm{meet}(S) = \bigcap_{A ∈ S} A.
$$

To prove this definition of _meet_ gives `DM P` a semilattice structure, we have to show the result of such an intersection satisfies the `upper-lower` condition. First we define the intersection of a subset of `DM P` (i.e. of a set of sets taken from `DM P`). -/

def DM.inter {P : Type u} [Poset P] (S : Set (DM P)) := { x | ∀ T ∈ S, x ∈ T.val }

/- We will need to use the simple fact that the interection of a family ot sets is a subset of every member of the family. -/

theorem DM.inter_sub {P : Type u} [Poset P] {S : Set (DM P)}
  : ∀ T ∈ S, inter S ⊆ T.val := by
  intro T hT x hx
  exact hx T hT

/- Using this fact, we can show the intersection preserves the `lower-upper` property required of elements of `DM P`. -/

theorem DM.inter_in_dm {P : Type u} [Poset P] {S : Set (DM P)}
  : lower (upper (inter S)) = inter S := by
    apply Set.eq_of_subset_of_subset
    . intro x hx T hT
      rw[←T.h]
      exact sub_low (sub_up (inter_sub T hT)) hx
    . exact sub_lu (inter S)

/- And with this theorem we can finally define the _meet_ as a function from `Set (DM P)` into `DM P`. Recall, that to do so we need to not only supply the operation `inter` on `S`, but also proof that `inter S` is in `DM P`. -/

def DM.meet {P : Type u} [Poset P] (S : Set (DM P)) : DM P :=
  ⟨ inter S, inter_in_dm ⟩

/- To show that `DM P` is a Complete Semilattice, we need to show that this definition of `meet` is indeed a greatest lower bound. We do so in two steps, first showing the `meet S` is a lower bound of `S` and second showing it is a greatest lower bound of `S`. -/

theorem DM.meet_lb {P : Type u} [Poset P] :
  ∀ S : Set (DM P), IsLB S (meet S) := by
  intro S T hT
  apply DM.inter_sub
  exact hT

theorem DM.meet_greatest {P : Type u} [Poset P]
  : ∀ S : Set (DM P), ∀ w, (IsLB S w) → w ≤ meet S := by
  intro S W h
  intro x hx T hT
  exact h T hT hx

/- Now we have everything we need to instantiate the Complete Semilattice class. -/

instance DM.csl {P : Type u} [Poset P] : CompleteSemilattice (DM P) :=
  ⟨ meet, meet_lb, meet_greatest ⟩


/- ## The Join

Next we define a join. It would be nice to simply define the join of `S` to be the union of all sets in `S`, but the result would in general not be closed with respect to the `lower-upper` operator used to define `DM P`. To get around this, the join for `DM P` is defined to be the intersection of sets containing the union.

$$
\mathrm{join}(S) = \bigcap \left \\{ B \in DM(P) \\;|\\; \bigcup_{A ∈ S} A \subseteq B \right \\}
$$

First we define the union. -/

def DM.union {P : Type u} [Poset P] (S : Set (DM P)) := { x | ∃ T ∈ S, x ∈ T.val }

/- We will need an intermediate theorem analogous to the intersection theorem proved for the meet. This one shows that the intersection of a set of sets is contained in each set. -/

theorem DM.inter_union_dm {P : Type u} [Poset P] {S : Set (DM P)}
  : ∀ C ∈ {C : DM P| union S ⊆ C.val}, inter {C | union S ⊆ C.val} ⊆ C.val := by
    intro C hC x hx
    exact hx C hC

/- We use this theorem to show the meet is closed. -/

theorem DM.union_in_dm {P : Type u} [Poset P] {S : Set (DM P)}
  : lower (upper (inter {C | union S ⊆ C.val})) = inter {C | union S ⊆ C.val} := by
  apply Set.eq_of_subset_of_subset
  . intro x hx T hT
    rw[←T.h]
    exact sub_low (sub_up (inter_union_dm T hT)) hx
  . apply sub_lu

/- The join operator is then be defined as follows. -/

def DM.join {P : Type u} [Poset P] (S : Set (DM P)) : DM P :=
  ⟨ inter { C | union S ⊆ C.val }, union_in_dm ⟩

/- To show `DM P` is a Complete Lattice, we need to show the join is a least upper bound, which we do in two steps. -/

theorem DM.join_ub {P : Type u} [Poset P] :
  ∀ S : Set (DM P), IsUB S (join S) := by
  intro S T hT x hx W hW
  simp[union,Set.subset_def] at hW
  exact hW x T hT hx

theorem DM.join_least {P : Type u} [Poset P]
  : ∀ S : Set (DM P), ∀ W, (IsUB S W) → join S ≤ W := by
  intro S W h x hx
  apply hx W
  intro y ⟨ Q, ⟨ h1, h2 ⟩ ⟩
  exact h Q h1 h2

/- Now we have everything we need to show `DM P` is a Complete Lattice. -/

instance DM.lattice {P : Type u} [Poset P] : CompleteLattice (DM P) :=
  ⟨ join, join_ub, join_least ⟩


/- ## Completion Map

The mapping from `P` into `DM P` is defined implicitly in the construction of `DM P`. Explicitly, the embedding is definition by the `down` operator.  That is, the map `λ x ↦ down x` is the ordering embedding that wintesses the completion. To show this, we prove that `down x` is closed under the `lower-upper` closure operator. -/

theorem DM.down_is_dm {P : Type u} [Poset P] {x : P}
  : lower (upper (down x)) = down x :=
  by
    apply Set.eq_of_subset_of_subset
    . intro y hy
      exact hy x fun a a ↦ a
    . intro a ha
      simp_all[upper,lower]

/- This theorem then allows us to formally define the embedded. We call it `make`, because it allows us to _make_ an element of `DM P` out of any element `x ∈ P`. -/

def DM.make {P : Type u} [Poset P] (x : P) : DM P := ⟨ down x, down_is_dm ⟩

/- Finally, we prove that `make` is an order embeddeding (as defined in [Maps](./Maps.md)). -/

theorem DM.make_embed {P : Type u} [Poset P]
  : OrderEmbedding (make : P → DM P) := by
  intro x y
  constructor
  . intro h z hz
    exact Poset.trans z x y hz h
  . intro h
    simp[make,down,le_inst,Poset.le] at h
    exact h x (Poset.refl x)




/- ## Completion of a Total Order

If `P` is a totally ordered set, then its completion ought to be totally ordered as well. We show that here. We start with a useful theorem stating the fact that all elements of `DM P` are downward closed. -/

theorem dm_down_close {P : Type u} [Poset P] {X : DM P}
  : ∀ y, ∀ x ∈ X.val, y ≤ x → y ∈ X.val := by
  intro y x hx hyx
  rw[←X.h] at hx ⊢
  intro z hz
  apply Poset.trans y x z hyx (hx z hz)

/- Now we show the main result. -/

theorem dm_total_order {P : Type u} [TotalOrder P]
  : ∀ (x y : DM P), Comparable x y := by

  intro X Y
  by_cases h : X.val ⊆ Y.val

  . exact Or.inl h

  . -- Obtain an x in X - Y
    obtain ⟨ x, ⟨ hx, hxny ⟩ ⟩ := Set.not_subset.mp h

    -- Show y ≤ x using the fact that Y is closed
    rw[←Y.h] at hxny
    simp[lower] at hxny
    obtain ⟨ y, ⟨ hy, hcomp ⟩ ⟩ := hxny
    have hyx : y ≤ x := by
      apply Or.elim (TotalOrder.comp x y)
      . intro h
        exact False.elim (hcomp h)
      . exact id

    -- Show Y ⊆ down x using transitivity of ≤ in P
    have hYdx : Y.val ⊆ down x := by
      intro b hb
      exact Poset.trans b y x (hy b hb) hyx

    -- Show down x ⊆ X using the helper theorem above
    have hdxX: down x ⊆ X.val := by
      intro b hb
      exact dm_down_close b x hx hb

    -- Show Y ⊆ X using transitivity of ⊆
    apply Or.inr
    intro q hq
    exact hdxX (hYdx hq)

/- Using this theorem, we can instantiate the total order class for `DM P` for any totally ordered `P`. -/

instance {P : Type u} [TotalOrder P] : TotalOrder (DM P) := ⟨ dm_total_order ⟩
