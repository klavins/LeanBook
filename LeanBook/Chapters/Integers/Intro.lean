Now that we have defined the natural numbers `Nat`, the next obvious step is to define the integers `Int`(whole numbers that can be positive, negative or zero) . This can be done in several ways. For example, the Lean 4 standard library defines integers inductively saying that (a) any natural number is an integer, and (b) the negative successor of an integer is an integer.
