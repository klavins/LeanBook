/- # Multiplication

Multiplication of Dedekind cuts is straightfoward, but also fairly involved, or as Rudin says: "bothersome". The issue is dealing with both positive and negative cuts. Following Rudin, the development of the definitions proceeds as follows:

- Define multiplication on positive cuts.
- Extend multiplciation on positive cuts to non-negative cuts, building on the previous step by handling the cases in which either or both of the cuts is zero.
- Extend multiplication on non-negative cuts to all cuts.

For each of the above definitions of multiplication, we also prove the properties required to show that multiplication forms a commutiative group on cuts:
- 0 is an identity: `0*x = 0`
- Multiplication is commutative: `x*y = y*x`
- Associativity: `x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z`
The last property is particularly challenging, because to relate arbitary reals with positive reals, one has to deal with an abundance of cases, preferably gracefully. Thus, along the way we will prove several intermediate results which allow us to make the proof more concise. -/

/- ## Definitions

### Multiplication of Positive Cuts

Given two positive cuts `0 < a` and `0 < b`, their product is the set of points `z` such that for some `x ∈ a` and `y ∈ b`, `z < x*y`. This basic definition underlies the entire framework for multiplication, after which we simply have to deal with various combinations of non-negative and negative numbers. -/

def pre_mul (a b : DCut) :=
  { z | ∃ x ∈ a.A, ∃ y ∈ b.A, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ z < x*y }

theorem pre_mulalt (a b : DCut)
  :  { z | ∃ x ∈ a.A, ∃ y ∈ b.A, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ z < x*y } =
     { z | ∃ x y, x ∈ a.A ∧ y ∈ b.A ∧ 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ z < x*y } := by
  simp

/- To prove that this definition results in a cut, we need to prove as usual that it is non-empty, not equal to ℚ, downward closed, and open.  -/

  ⟨ pre_mul a b, pre_mul_ne ha hb, pre_mul_nf ha hb, pre_mul_dc, pre_mul_op ⟩

/- We will need the following property to extend multiplication from positive numbers to non-negative numbers stating that the product of two positive numbers is again positive. Thus, the definition `pre_mul` operates exclusively on the positive reals. -/

/- ### Multiplication on Non-negative Cuts

We now extend the definition to non-negative reals, essentially dealing with the cases in which either cut is zero, in which case the resulting product is zero. Indeed, if one of `a` and `b` is zero, then `pre_mul a b = ∅`. -/

    linarith

/- Since `∅` is not a valid cut, we use `pre_mul a b ∪ odown 0` to represent the product of two non-negative cuts. The remaining theorems are required to show that the result is a cut. We simply, and laboriously, have to deal with the possible cases. -/

    mul_nneg_ne,
    mul_nneg_nf ha hb,
    @mul_nneg_dc a b,
    @mul_nneg_op a b ⟩

/- ### Mulitiplication on Arbitrary Cuts

Finally, we extend multiiplcation to arbitrary cuts. This step uses the fact that every cut `a` can be written as the difference `max 0 a - max 0 (-a)`. If `0 ≤ a` then
```hs
max 0 a - max 0 (-a) = a + 0
```
and if `a < 0` then
```hs
max 0 a - max 0 (-a) = 0 + -a
```
both of which are non-negative, and we can therefore use the previous definition of multiplication on non-negative cuts.
-/

def mul (a b : DCut) : DCut :=
  let ap := maximum 0 a
  let an := maximum 0 (-a)
  let bp := maximum 0 b
  let bn := maximum 0 (-b)
  (mul_nneg ap bp (max_gz _) (max_gz _)) +
  (mul_nneg an bn (max_gz _) (max_gz _)) -
  (mul_nneg ap bn (max_gz _) (max_gz _)) -
  (mul_nneg an bp (max_gz _) (max_gz _))

/- ## Multiplication by 0

For non-negative cuts, it is useful to know that `0*a = 0` and `a*0 = 0`, as these properties allow us to reason about the zero cases in the non-negative commutativity proof. These properties also allow us to show that `0` is the multiplicative identity, which is needed for proving cuts with multiplication form a group. -/
